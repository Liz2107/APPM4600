Elizabeth Cutting - APPM4600 
This is the location of my classwork for APPM4600.
It contains the Homework and Labs for the class.
The Homework file contains images and code used to do the Homework.
The Labs file contains the work I do for each lab.
It will be updated with my homework and labs as they are completed, which will be 1-2 times per week.
